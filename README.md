## Problems

Problem description
King Caesar would like us to create the calculator program, which can add a
Roman numeral in order to save our manual effort.

For example
- “XX” + “II” = “XXII”
- “II” + “II” = “IV”
- “XIV” + “LX” = “LXXIV”
- “V” + “V” = “X”

· Input file format
```
XX+II
II+II
XIV+LX
V+V
```

· Output format
```
XXII
IV
LXXIV
X
```

## How to run
I already compile project into bin folder
after run this program will show prompt to ask for file
`Input Roman file: <path to your file>` (I already prepare file at `src/javatar/simple/demo/roman-test.txt`)


eg.
```
Input Roman file: /Users/fake-or-dead/Sites/javatar/src/javatar/simple/demo/roman-test.txt
XXII
IV
LXXIV
X
Success process :  /Users/fake-or-dead/Sites/javatar/src/javatar/simple/demo/roman-test.txt
```
